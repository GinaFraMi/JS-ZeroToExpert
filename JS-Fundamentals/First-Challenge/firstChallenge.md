Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:

`BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)`.

Your tasks:

- Store Mark's and John's mass and heightinvariables
- CalculateboththeirBMIsusingtheformula(you can even implement both versions)
- CreateaBooleanvariable'markHigherBMI'containingin formation about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data: 
- Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
- Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
